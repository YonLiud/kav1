# Kav1 Visitor Management System

Kav1 is a modern visitor management system designed to streamline guest check-ins and improve security in controlled environments.
It features a PySide6 desktop frontend and a FastAPI backend, connected through a lightweight REST API with support for real-time updates via WebSocket.

Kav1 is ideal for environments where offline-capable, locally hosted visitor management is preferred over cloud-based tools.
